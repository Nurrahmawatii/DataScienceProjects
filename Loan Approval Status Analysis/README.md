## üë®‚Äçüíª About me :

For a proper introduction, my name is Nurrahmawati, and usually call me Rahma.

Welcome to my analysis dashboard notebook! This is where I will be working on the Task Dashboard for loan approval status analysis. In this file, I will be building an interactive dashboard to analyze the dataset provided by the Lion Parcel. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the patterns and trends present in the loan data provided to prospective borrowers. I have utilized Google Data Studio as the platform to visualize the data in the form of an interactive dashboard. You can visit the dashboard by clicking on the following link: [Link to the Google Data Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/3fecfd13-cb6b-4727-a026-11d6defec10a)
