### Loan Approval Status Analysis

Welcome to my analysis dashboard notebook! This is where I will be working on the Task Dashboard for loan approval status analysis. In this file, I will be building an interactive dashboard to analyze the dataset provided by the Lion Parcel. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the patterns and trends present in the loan data provided to prospective borrowers. I have utilized Google Data Studio as the platform to visualize the data in the form of an interactive dashboard. You can visit the dashboard by clicking on the following link: [Link to the Google Data Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/3fecfd13-cb6b-4727-a026-11d6defec10a)

Here are the list of conclusion in this project:
1.   Credit History is a significant factor in loan approval. This indicates the importance of having a good credit history when applying for a loan.
2.   Income is an important consideration in loan approval. The average income for approved loans is slightly lower (`$5,208.73`) compared to not approved loans (`$5,600.94`). This suggests that income plays a role in loan approval, but it is not the sole determining factor. Other factors, such as credit history and employment status, also influence the decision.
3.   Loan Approval Percentage: In this dataset, the percentage of approved loans is 69.5%, while the percentage of not approved loans is 30.5%.
4.   Gender and Marital Status: The majority of borrowers are males, whether married or unmarried. However, the percentage of unmarried female borrowers who are approved is higher than that of married female borrowers.
5.   Education and Employment Status: Graduate borrowers have a higher approval rate, regardless of their employment status (self-employed or not self-employed). However, the percentage of non-self-employed borrowers who are approved is higher than that of self-employed borrowers.
6.   Loan Amount Distribution: The distribution of loan amounts shows positive skewness with a value of 2.55. This indicates that the majority of loans fall within a lower range of amounts.
7.   Property Area: Borrowers from semiurban areas have a higher approval rate and a lower rejection rate compared to other areas.
